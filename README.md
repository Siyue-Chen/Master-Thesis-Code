## AttnGAN & ControlGAN
In this program, AttnGAN and ControlGAN is run in Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.1.

In order to run AttnGAN and ControlGAN, download the birds image data, from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html. Extract them to data/birds/

For AttnGAN, file run_attnGAN.ipynb is the file that run AttnGAN.
For ControlGAN, file run_ControlGAN.ipynb is the file that run ControlGAN.


## Inception Score
Folder Inception Score is used to calculate inception score. File is the file inception_score.ipynb that run inception score.
