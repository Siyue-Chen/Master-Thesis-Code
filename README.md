# Master-Thesis-Code

This URL contains the main code we used in the Master of Science research.

## AttnGAN & ControlGAN
In this program, AttnGAN and ControlGAN is run in Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.1.

In order to run AttnGAN and ControlGAN, download the birds image data, from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html. Extract them to data/birds/

For AttnGAN, file run_attnGAN.ipynb is the file that run AttnGAN.
For ControlGAN, file run_ControlGAN.ipynb is the file that run ControlGAN.


## Inception Score
Folder Inception Score is used to calculate inception score. File inception_score.ipynb is the file that run inception score.

## loss function handling
This folder contains the code that plot the loss function. File loss.ipynb is the file that plot loss function.

## image
File image.ipynb is used to summary the self-defined index in thesis.
